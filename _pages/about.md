Welcome to my website! I am a fifth year Ph.D student in Decision Sciences at Fuqua School of Business, Duke University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Alexandre Belloni](https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~abn5/belloni-index.html?_ga=2.245151173.1198594769.1596235423-1333425513.1594055969) currently. Previously, I obtained my master in [Statistics](http://www.bu.edu/stat/) at Boston University. During the time at BU, it is my pleasure to be advised by [Prof. Daniel Sussman](http://math.bu.edu/people/sussman/) and [Prof. Konstantinos Spiliopoulos](http://math.bu.edu/people/kspiliop/) to explore graph matching in network and system risk. Prior to my master, I received my Bachlor degrees in Economics and Software Engineering in [Guangdong University of Foreign Studies](https://iie-en.gdufs.edu.cn). Before going to college, I spent three amazing years at Guiyang No.1 high school. 

Research Interests
======
My research interest lies in empirical process, methodology and applications of causal inference. In particular, I am interested in the convergence rate of error measures for machine learning algortihms by using tools in empirical process. 

I am currently working on developing methodology for estimating treatment effect by matching method under network interference with [Prof. Alexandre Belloni](https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~abn5/belloni-index.html?_ga=2.245151173.1198594769.1596235423-1333425513.1594055969) and [Prof. Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io). Meanwhile, I am working on estimating causal effect of name order on election ballot with clustered data with [Prof. Alessandro Arlotto](http://people.duke.edu/~aa249/?_ga=2.206868819.1198594769.1596235423-1333425513.1594055969).
