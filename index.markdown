# About me

Welcome to my website!

I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University, where I have the privilege of working with Prof. [Laura Forastiere](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/laura-forastiere/) at Yale and Prof. [Edoardo M. Airoldi](https://airoldi.github.io) at Temple University. I earned my Ph.D. in Decision Sciences from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Alexandre Belloni](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/alexandre-belloni). Prior to that, I obtained my M.A. in Statistics from Boston University, where I had the pleasure of being advised by Prof. [Daniel Sussman](https://www.bu.edu/math/profile/daniel-sussman/) and Prof. [Konstantinos Spiliopoulos](https://math.bu.edu/people/kspiliop/).

## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on causal inference under network interference. Specifically, I am interested in:

- Defining meaningful and interpretable estimands for spillover effects.
- Developing computational and interpretable estimators for both average and conditional spillover effects in large-scale settings.
- Designing adaptive estimators for spillover effects that effectively balance the bias-variance tradeoff.
- Developing algorithms to identify optimal treatment rules under network interference.
- Extending spillover effect estimation by incorporating complex settings alongside network interference, such as jointly addressing biased sampling and network interference.

Beyond these core areas, I am also exploring causal discovery for extreme events. On the applied side, I am particularly interested in leveraging causal inference methods to support social scientists and medical researchers in deriving robust and trustworthy conclusions for their research problems.

I’d be delighted to [connect](mailto:fei.fang@yale.edu) if any of these interest you!
